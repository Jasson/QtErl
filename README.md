QtErl
=====

QtErl is a library for building erlang applications with support for graphical
user interface using the Qt framework.

QtErl is still in its infancy, exploring suitable API's and design desicions.
It is too early for real adoption, but it is excellent time to get involved
if you care to influence the future direction of the project.


Current state
-------------

It's a proof of concept. I am using Qt 5.0.1 on windows, the MingW version.
